Senior technicians display excellent knowledge within their assigned skill-sets to the degree they are “go to” people within their support segment.  They are looked upon as approachable by their teammates and are able to act as mentors for newer associates.  118 associates lead by example and project a positive “can do” attitude.  The Senior Technical Support Specialist’s impact on the customer experience is a mix of direct and indirect. Has a direct impact on the customer experience (CSF/WHA) by how they service our customers, and has an indirect impact on the customer experience (CSF/WHA) by setting an example and assisting other technicians in supporting our customers. Promotes teamwork and takes ownership of their actions, decisions and consequences, and focuses on solving problems rather than assigning blame. Proactively identifies areas for improvement within their segment and provides the necessary feedback to help in this process.  Must have the capability of supporting multiple skills within their segment, and be exhibiting excellent product knowledge within those skills.  Our 118 associate is a proficient deliverer of CSF and WHA, and has a clear understanding of the value Technical Support provides.

There is nothing to coach on since it was a sample set of 2.

Most of your time is spent on taking calls, with lunch being on top of the list of most used NR states, 2nd would be BREAK, and 3rd is BRANCH support.

Very well done in terms of accuracy - you did not incur any RMAs. Not only you are accurate, but you are reliable in terms of attendance, with no tardiness nor absences for the said month. I also want to call out the great use of ACW, with ACW only using up 1.91% of your time. Good job!

Your opportunities for the month that needs to be resolved and non-recurring by this month - first would be the issue of call logging. You had 1 instance of QUBE (you were unable to clone the quote since you offered a 3rd party option as an alternative). Second is that your datacenter handle time is 5 minutes longer than the team's average, the same gap from last month's data.

For your opportunities, we have your average handle time. AHT is around 14.89 minutes, which is higher than the team average. Although an opportunity, it's not entirely ""bad"", listening to one of your calls made me think that being thorough has its merits, and we cannot sacrifice quality over quantity. It's something that we need to work on, but until we have a concrete AHT  for measurement per line, I want you to think of ways to shorten your handle time.

We tried to move Andrew to the CLR phase, but ran into issues during the talking/typing phase yesterday and today (July 11th-12th, 2018). Mark stated that Andrew would freeze up, not respond to direct questions, and has regressed in progress since his previous role-play sessions. Andrew would also click fields in IM360 that did not pertain to his role, would take longer-than-normal on non-complex calls (1 hr +), and would not reach out for help when needed. <br> Andrews perspective:<br> Andrew stated that IM360 was non-responsive, so he was clicking those fields to see if any part of the tool was working. He said he does not normally become a ""deer in headlights"", but he did become non-reactive and felt overwhelmed on today's call, and the 2 yesterday. He said Mark was ""mad"" at him because of the way he phrased something to one of our Canadian customers. Andrew said, we do not carry this in Canada - but they could source it somewhere else. I explained that this ties to our ""never give them a reason to call the competition"" philosophy, but maybe Mark could use some tact and diplomacy explaining this point. Andrew seemed to understand why Mark emphasized this point with him. Andrew also said that he preferred to keep the IM360 window fully expanded, while Mark instructed him to keep it smaller. <br> Ultimately, Andrew agreed to keep working with Mark, listen closely, take and apply feedback, and to communicate effectively and often. We will discuss the details in our upcoming sync today."

Here's what we've discussed earlier.

Acknowledgement and Understanding 
Is asking the question “where will you be using this?” or “what will be the business use of the product?” enough for us to have a full understanding of the business use? The answer is NO. 
The keyword here is DEPLOYMENT. We need to understand the deployment of the product. 
Suppose a customer called in for a system for basic office use, we need to ask more questions like what specific applications are they going to be using, budget and even the environment where the system is going to be placed in. If the reseller does not have the answer we should always offer to conference the end-user in.

Full Solutions
This usually goes hand in hand with having a full understanding of the business need. Once you understand the DEPLOYMENT you will be able to wear your technical advisor hat. From there you can start positioning items that they might need like cables, graphic cards, docking stations, monitors or even position cross segment solutions like peripherals, networking and storage products.
