There were several times wherein you wanted to convey a large chunk of message and the customer got lost in what you are saying. 

Example would be at the 3:30-minute mark when you mentioned something about the system and the price. 

After getting back from hold you explained to the customer that you already found an option for the yoga and that you are working on the other laptop. You were explaining to the customer that the system is not compatible with a mechanical dock but will work with a usb-c dock and proceeded to giving more information about the system being the only one that's within the price point that they desire. The customer had to stop you to clarify the information.

Coaching here is that, when providing information, if the information is complex try to break it down to little chunks that will be beneficial and understandable for the customer. Also, though this one takes experience to learn, try your best to assess the customer's technical capabilities based on the responses you are getting to your questions.",Full Solution,There's an opportunity in the full solution area.

We could sense frustrations from the customer through her short and long sighs especially when she was informed the video card will be installed via PCIE16 particularly when Mel made his voice louder instead of saying it in a much slower pace and clearly enunciate the words. He too has tendencies to sound sarcastic when asked to elaborate further. 

Overall, I feel like it was the customer who is in control of the mood all throughout  the call. When she laughs, that makes the conversation lighter. Mel just got lucky, the customer is nice to him – this should never be the case. We should make all customer interactions a pleasant experience.

In the end, I am confident Mel can be the same Mel our customers liked and would find time to send good feedback. Please work with him.

Good job in matching the specifications.

By asking open ended questions this opens up a big opportunity to provide full solutions.

I also liked the fact that you offered to provide an HP solution for them to consider.

On Full Solution:
We need to go back to having a full solutions mindset meaning, we don't just quote part numbers. We get a bigger perspective and real understanding of the business need then we build from there. The goal is to add value to the customer's business by recommending add-ons that make sense like maybe extended warranty, a carry case or even a cross technology solution.

On point, quick review on FULL SOLUTIONS:  this may not directly apply to this call, but a heads up on what we should do consistently.
FULL SOLUTIONS -  needs to be executed in every call, this entails from understanding the business need / usage through probing, providing viable solution that is in stock within working budget and meets spec requirement for the usage, with the attempt or proactive offering of applicable add-ons ( upsell and cross sell opportunities). Offering of common addons should be a STANDARD like warranty uplifts, back up solution, OS licenses, etc..

During the part where you are probing, you were unable to recap the part number. Nothing major, but note that if you ever get the part wrong, there's a chance that it will lead to an inaccurate solution. Another opportunity that I observed in the call was you almost failed to discuss the solution - which could merit you BELOW expectations on the call.

In terms of opportunities, let's start with the process. You were unable to collect the close date and discuss the target price. If you think about it, these are also crucial to enable full solution. The close date determines availability of the product come purchase time. The target price determines whether the customer has enough purchasing power to buy the items. In terms of customer experience, you need to work on your attitude and tone of voice. At times, you seem disengaged, and lacks enthusiasm. These can all be seen due to the inconsistency of your tone, being monotonous most of the time.
